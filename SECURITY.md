Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Policy on Bounties and Payments

**This project does not offer a bug bounty program.** We are an open-source project maintained by volunteers. While we greatly appreciate community contributions and security reports, we do not offer financial compensation for identifying vulnerabilities. Please do not submit reports with the expectation of payment.

## Policy on Automated AI Reports

We do not accept automated security reports or fixes generated solely by Artificial Intelligence tools (LLMs, automated scanners, etc.) without human verification. Reports must be validated and reproducible. Pull requests containing code solely generated by AI for security fixes will be closed.
